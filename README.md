# tictactoe
An unbeatable tic tac toe game written in node and running in the command line

This challenge allowed me to learn and practice the node process object, which I hadn't worked with before. This is also my first time writing tests, and I plan on increasing their coverage in this repo and others.

To do:

-Write more complete and full-coverage tests

-Construct a UI
