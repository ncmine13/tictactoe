# tictactoe
An unbeatable tic tac toe game written in node and running in the command line

To play: clone the repo and run node game.js from the js folder in the root directory. Make sure you have Node.js installed globally.



To do:

• Write more complete and full-coverage tests

• Construct a UI


This challenge allowed me to learn and practice the node process object, which I hadn't worked with before. This is also my first time writing tests, and I plan on increasing their coverage in this repo and others.
